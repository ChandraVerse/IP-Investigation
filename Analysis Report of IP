🧭 Investigation Goal (What this report proves)
This report documents the threat posture of a suspicious public IP by collecting VirusTotal’s key intelligence blocks: detections, network/ASN identity, reputation, infrastructure relations, and timeline indicators.
The intent is to make the output usable for: 🛡️ SOC triage, 🚫 blocking decisions, 🧾 incident tickets, and 📊 stakeholder reporting.

🧨 Detection Overview (Vendor Consensus)
✅ What VirusTotal shows
VirusTotal’s detection banner indicates “10/95 security vendors flagged this IP address as malicious.”
This means a minority of vendors report it as malicious, but the count is significant enough to treat as a credible threat signal—especially when paired with negative community feedback.

📋 Observed vendor verdicts (visible in screenshot)
From the “Security vendors’ analysis” list shown:
🛑 Malicious (examples shown): CRDF, CyRadar, IPsum, SOCRadar, Criminal IP, EmergingThreats, GreenSnow, Lionic
🦠 Malware (examples shown): Fortinet, VIPRE
⚠️ Suspicious (examples shown): alphaMountain.ai, Gridinsoft
✅ Clean (examples shown): Abusix, ADMINUSLabs, AlienVault, benkow.cc, Acronis, AILabs (MONITORAPP), Antiy-AVL, BitDefender

🧠 Analyst interpretation (for reporting)
🔥 The IP has multi-vendor risk labeling (Malicious/Malware/Suspicious) which increases credibility versus a single-vendor outlier.
⚖️ At the same time, the presence of many “Clean” verdicts implies it may be context-dependent (e.g., abused hosting, short-lived activity, or vendor coverage differences).

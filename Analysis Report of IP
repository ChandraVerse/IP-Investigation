🕵️‍♂️ Threat Intelligence Report — IP Investigation (VirusTotal)

📌 Case Header
🧾 Case Title: IP Investigation Using VirusTotal
🌐 Investigated IP: 2.57.121.112 
🗂️ Platform: VirusTotal (IP reputation & telemetry view) 
🕒 Freshness (VT): Last Analysis Date: 2 days ago 
🎛️ Community Signal: Community Score: -7 



🧭 Investigation Goal (What this report proves)

This report documents the threat posture of a suspicious public IP by collecting VirusTotal’s key intelligence blocks: detections, network/ASN identity, reputation, infrastructure relations, and timeline indicators.
The intent is to make the output usable for: 🛡️ SOC triage, 🚫 blocking decisions, 🧾 incident tickets, and 📊 stakeholder reporting.

🧨 Detection Overview (Vendor Consensus)

✅ What VirusTotal shows
VirusTotal’s detection banner indicates “10/95 security vendors flagged this IP address as malicious.”
This means a minority of vendors report it as malicious, but the count is significant enough to treat as a credible threat signal—especially when paired with negative community feedback.


📋 Observed vendor verdicts (visible in screenshot)

From the “Security vendors analysis” list shown:
🛑 Malicious (examples shown): CRDF, CyRadar, IPsum, SOCRadar, Criminal IP, EmergingThreats, GreenSnow, Lionic
🦠 Malware (examples shown): Fortinet, VIPRE
⚠️ Suspicious (examples shown): alphaMountain.ai, Gridinsoft
✅ Clean (examples shown): Abusix, ADMINUSLabs, AlienVault, benkow.cc, Acronis, AILabs (MONITORAPP), Antiy-AVL, BitDefender


🧠 Analyst interpretation (for reporting)

🔥 The IP has multi-vendor risk labeling (Malicious/Malware/Suspicious) which increases credibility versus a single-vendor outlier.
⚖️ At the same time, the presence of many “Clean” verdicts implies it may be context-dependent (e.g., abused hosting, short-lived activity, or vendor coverage differences).



🧾 Basic Information (ASN - Location - ISP/Provider)

🌐 Identity & routing context
🌍 IP Address: 2.57.121.112 
🧱 Network (CIDR): 2.57.120.0/23 
🏢 ASN: AS47890 
🏷️ AS Label / Provider (shown): Unmanaged Ltd 


📍 Geo / registry indicators (from VT Details)

🗺️ Country: RO (Romania) 
🌍 Continent: EU 
🏛️ Regional Internet Registry: RIPE NCC



⭐ Reputation Section (Community & Trust Signal)

👥 Community Score
VirusTotal displays Community Score: -7, which is a direct negative reputation indicator captured in the report header area.
In reporting terms, this supports phrasing like: “Community sentiment is negative, increasing risk confidence when combined with vendor flags.”


🧩 Community activity indicator
The UI shows the Community tab with “49”, which can be recorded as an engagement/indicator count visible in the interface.



🔗 Relations (Infrastructure & Ownership Signals)
🧬 Historical WHOIS lookups
In the Relations view, VirusTotal shows Historical Whois Lookups (2) for this IP context. 
The visible entries include “Last Updated” dates 2023-07-20 and 2020-08-24, and an organization label shown as RIPE Network Coordination Centre.



🧠 Why Relations matter
Relations/WHOIS history helps answer:
🔄 Did ownership/registration context change around suspicious activity?
🏢 Is the network tied to a known hosting/provider footprint that gets abused?
🧷 Does the IP belong to a broader range (2.57.120.0/23) worth monitoring as a set?



🗓️ Timeline (Recency + Historical checkpoints)
⏱️ Recency (security posture now)
🕒 Last Analysis Date: 2 days ago (from VT header)

📚 Historical context (registration snapshots)
🗓️ WHOIS historical timestamps shown: 2023-07-20, 2020-08-24

✅ Reporting-friendly phrasing: “Current vendor detections were observed from a recent analysis snapshot (2 days). WHOIS history shows at least two historical checkpoints (2020, 2023) useful for change tracking.”



🚦 Risk Rating (Human-style verdict)

🧩 Risk posture based on available evidence
Given 10/95 malicious flags plus Community Score -7, this IP should be treated as Suspicious → Potentially Malicious until validated against internal logs (traffic direction, destination ports, frequency, process/user context).
This is a strong-enough signal for monitoring and correlation, and may justify temporary containment if observed in confirmed malicious chains (phishing callback, brute-force attempts, C2-like periodic beacons, etc.).



🛡️ Recommended Actions (SOC/IR-ready)

🔍 Validate internally: Search SIEM/Firewall/Proxy/DNS logs for hits to/from 2.57.121.112.
🧷 Scope expansion: Also check the broader network 2.57.120.0/23 for related activity.
🚫 Containment decision: If seen in suspicious auth patterns / scanning / malware traffic, block at perimeter and add to watchlist.
🧾 Document evidence: Save VT link + screenshot evidence + timestamps (Last analysis: 2 days; WHOIS checkpoints).
